# Bandwidth Reservation with Queues
<p>
<p>
<h5>This project aims to simulate queues in switches and show the benefit of bandwidth reservation for different classes of applications that use the network of such switches as compared to switches without queues. <h5>
<p>
<h6>Congestion Creator -> This .py File is a python script to create a network of hosts and switches and pass a great deal traffic, to show the negative effects of congestion on throughput. <h6>
<p>
<h6>Graph Creator -> Using the matplotlib and pandas python data visualization libraries, we can generate a graphical depiction of the fall in throughput, with an increase in UDP congestion.<h6>
<p>
<h6>Sample Output  -> This file shows some example output written into the file, output.txt, by the congestioncreator.py file. It was generated by a real run of the project.
